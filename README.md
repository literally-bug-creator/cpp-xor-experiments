# What is it?

**Problem Statement**: Given an array of single-byte numbers, any preprocessing is allowed (except XOR operations), compute the XOR of all elements and output the result.

**Goal**: Explore different preprocessing and algorithmic approaches to find the **fastest possible implementation** for computing array XOR.

# Use cases

This research project is useful for:

- **Algorithm Design Studies**: Understanding different approaches to the same computational problem
- **Educational Purposes**: Learning creative problem-solving techniques and preprocessing strategies
- **Performance Analysis**: Comparing time and space complexity of various algorithmic approaches
- **Interview Preparation**: Exploring unconventional solutions to array manipulation problems
- **Research**: Investigating the relationship between preprocessing and final computation efficiency
